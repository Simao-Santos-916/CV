                <p>My name is Simão Santos, and my dream is to further acquire knowledge in other field and to develop myself. The first year of the master’s in medical Electronics was concluded in University of Minho (Portugal). In Portugal, my studies cycle included the bachelor and the master’s position altogether, in 5 years. The first three years of studies are focused on the bachelor’s, and the following two are focused on the master’s theme.My background in Biomedical Engineering has given me a broad field of studies, from security and hygiene procedures in medical environments, to medical electronics and bio-informatics. My masters is more focused in Bioelectronics and medical imaging, where I have gained knowledge on programing in C++, python and MatLab, in machine learning, statistics and image processing algorithms.</p>
